  "game": "The Game",
  "gameDescription": "Each turn is timed. During each turn, the Guesser must try to make their teammates guess as many words as possible, while members of opposing teams have the role of checking that the Guesser is not using any taboo words. \r\n\r\nThe Guesser must hold this cellphone. At the end of each turn, the cellphone is passed to the player on their right. \r\n\r\nA word is considered guessed only if it is pronounced exactly as written on the screen, other verb forms and singular/plural forms are not valid.\r\n\r\nFor the Guesser, it is forbidden to:\r\n- say parts that compose the taboo words or the secret word (you cannot say 'pig' or 'thorn' if the word is 'Porcupine');\r\n- use the plural forms of the indicated words, not even in irregular forms (for example, you cannot say 'parks' to make your teammates guess 'park');\r\n- make gestures;\r\n- say 'rhymes with,' 'sounds like,' or 'looks like';\r\n- use abbreviations (for example, you cannot say 'PC' to suggest 'computer0).\r\n\r\nIf one of the players who is guessing pronounces one of the taboo words, that word becomes usable by the Guesser.",
